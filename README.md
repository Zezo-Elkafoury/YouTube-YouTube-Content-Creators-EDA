# YouTube Content Creator Analysis

Welcome to the YouTube Content Creator Analysis project! This repository contains code and insights into the YouTube content creator landscape. By analyzing a dataset of YouTube channels, we aim to uncover trends, influencers, and audience engagement patterns.

## Overview

In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset comprising various metrics of YouTube channels, including subscriber counts, views, likes, comments, categories, and geographical distribution. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we extract valuable insights into the dynamics of the YouTube platform.

## Key Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and translate categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends such as top-performing channels, popular content categories, geographical distribution of creators, and correlations between metrics.
- Insights into Audience Engagement: Investigate relationships between subscriber count and engagement metrics like likes and comments.
- Benchmarking and Top Performers: Identify top-performing content creators based on above-average performance across key metrics.
